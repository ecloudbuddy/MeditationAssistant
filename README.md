# Meditation Assistant
The best meditation timer for Android. Its features (e.g., automatically setting your device to vibrate/silent
while you meditate) and customization (e.g., choosing any file on your device as the start/finish/interval sound
for your session) make it the ideal assistant to your meditation practice.
